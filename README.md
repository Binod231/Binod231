### 🧑‍💻 About Me

🎓 I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student (Graduating May 2026)  at I.K. Gujral Punjab Technical University.

🌱 My goal is to pursue a fully-funded PhD in Computer Science. I am passionate about the fundamental challenges in:
*   **Distributed Systems & Cloud-Native Computing**
*   **Database Management & Performance Internals**
*   **Program Analysis & Systems Security**

💡 I thrive on bridging the gap between high-performance systems engineering and academic research. I enjoy diagnosing and solving complex, real-world bottlenecks to make systems more efficient and reliable.

🚀 **Key Achievement:** In a professional setting, I diagnosed and resolved a major performance bottleneck in a production PostgreSQL database. By applying a deep understanding of query planning and database internals, I successfully **reduced p95 query latency by 40%**.

🔬 **Current Research:** For my Major Project, I am designing and building a **static analysis tool to detect security vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications**. This is a "sophisticated undertaking"  that combines my interests in program analysis, security, and systems.

### 📂 Featured Projects

> My project work has evolved from building applications to analyzing and optimizing the complex systems that run them.

1.  **Production Database Optimization (PostgreSQL)**
    *   **Description:** Independently diagnosed and resolved critical performance bottlenecks in a live production database. This involved deep analysis of query planning, indexing strategies, and concurrency, resulting in a **40% reduction in p95 query latency**.
    *   **Skills:** `PostgreSQL`, `Database Performance Tuning`, `Query Optimization`, `System Diagnostics`.

2.  **Static Analysis Tool for Cloud-Native Security (Major Project)**
    *   **Description:** (In-Progress) Designing and building a static analysis tool to detect common security vulnerabilities and reliability issues in cloud-native applications (e.g., misconfigured Kubernetes manifests, insecure Go code).
    *   **Skills:** `Program Analysis`, `System Security`, `Go (Golang)`, `Kubernetes`, `Static Analysis`.

3.  **Intelligent Document Analysis System (Internship)**
    *   **Description:** As an intern, I co-designed and implemented a scalable system to analyze and extract insights from complex documents using Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and vector databases.
    *   **Skills:** `LLMs`, `RAG`, `Vector Databases`, `Python`, `System Design`.

4.  **STORES REST API**
    *   **Description:** A scalable, production-ready RESTful API built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. Features JWT authentication, resource-based design, and full database integration.
